# My Personal Website

Written in ``astro.js``. Please steal, it's quite customizable.
I try to update this regularly.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Here's a list of commands I've used previously that were useful.

```bash
npx npm-check-updates -u # update all dependencies to latest version 
```

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
```

## External

A list of external references to this website that I should try to maintain.
