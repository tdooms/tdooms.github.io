I&#39;m a second year PhD student working on mechanistic interpretability.</p> <p>My academic interest lies in understanding neural networks from their weights. <br/>

                    Tensor decompositions on the weights help us understand what is important to the model.</p> <p>I am guided by curiosity, strive for simplicity, and try to be effective.</p> <p>Outside of work, I love to go on long bike rides, game with friends, go skiing and wear shorts.</p></div></div></div>`,i;return a=new A({}),{c(){f(a.$$.fragment),t=u(),e=v("div"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(s){b(a.$$.fragment,s),t=g(s),e=k(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(e)!=="svelte-1f56ozr"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){w(e,"class","columns")},m(s,n){y(a,s,n),l(s,t,n),l(s,e,n),i=!0},p:d,i(s){i||(x(a.$$.fragment,s),i=!0)},o(s){I(a.$$.fragment,s),i=!1},d(s){s&&(r(t),r(e)),$(a,s)}}}class L extends p{constructor(a){super(),h(this,a,null,T,m,{})}}export{L as component};
