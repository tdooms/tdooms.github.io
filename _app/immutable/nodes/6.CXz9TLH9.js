I&#39;m a first year PhD student working on mechanistic interpretability in machine learning.</p> <p>My research focusses on understanding neural networks from their weights. 
                    This allows us to make guarantees about their behaviour and failure modes.</p> <p>Machine learning models have become an undeniably useful tool in recent years. 
                    Yet, they remain shrouded in mystery; both in research and everyday use. 
                    Understanding these models will not only help their trustworthiness but guarantee their utility.</p> <p>Outside of work, I love to go on long bike rides, game with friends, go skiing and wear shorts.</p></div></div></div>`,t;return e=new M({}),{c(){p(e.$$.fragment),i=f(),a=v("div"),a.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(s){b(e.$$.fragment,s),i=g(s),a=k(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),y(a)!=="svelte-1asndeb"&&(a.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){_(a,"class","columns")},m(s,n){w(e,s,n),r(s,i,n),r(s,a,n),t=!0},p:d,i(s){t||(x(e.$$.fragment,s),t=!0)},o(s){$(e.$$.fragment,s),t=!1},d(s){s&&(l(i),l(a)),I(e,s)}}}class j extends h{constructor(e){super(),u(this,e,null,T,m,{})}}export{j as component};
