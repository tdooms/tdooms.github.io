I&#39;m a first year PhD student working on mechanistic interpretability in machine learning.</p> <p>My research focusses on understanding neural networks from their weights. 
                    This allows us to make guarantees about their behaviour and failure modes.</p> <p>Machine learning models have become an undeniably useful tool in recent years. 
                    Yet, they remain shrouded in mystery; both in research and everyday use.
