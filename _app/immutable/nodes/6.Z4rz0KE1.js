I&#39;m a first year PhD student working on mechanistic interpretability in machine learning.</p> <p>I work under the supervision of Jose M. Oramas at the University of Antwerp within IDLab-imec. 
                    My research focusses on scaling up current mechanistic interpretability techniques to increasingly characterise current language models.</p> <p>Machine learning models have become an undeniably useful tool in recent years. 
                    Yet, they remain shrouded in mystery; both in research and everyday use. 
                    Understanding these models will not only help their trustworthiness but also make it easier to improve them.</p> <p>Outside of work, I love to go on long bike rides, game with friends and solve chess puzzles.</p></div></div></div>`,n;return e=new M({}),{c(){u(e.$$.fragment),i=f(),a=v("div"),a.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(s){b(e.$$.fragment,s),i=g(s),a=y(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),k(a)!=="svelte-14bd2mp"&&(a.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){_(a,"class","columns")},m(s,t){w(e,s,t),r(s,i,t),r(s,a,t),n=!0},p,i(s){n||(x(e.$$.fragment,s),n=!0)},o(s){$(e.$$.fragment,s),n=!1},d(s){s&&(l(i),l(a)),I(e,s)}}}class j extends d{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,null,L,m,{})}}export{j as component};
