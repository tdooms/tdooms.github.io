It is (hopefully) easy to follow without too much jargon. This way, if people ask what I am researching, I can refer them to this post. If this is you, hi again!",m,c,u="This post compares the evolution of the field of medicine to mechanistic interpretability. While thinking about this analogy, I found that the historic endeavours to understand the human body bear a surprising resemblance to our current quest of understanding neural networks. Therefore, I wanted to write up the similarities and attempt to learn some lessons from its process. Sadly, I know nothing about medicine so do not take any related claims too seriously.",d,p,oe="The quest to understand the body mostly originated from the need to heal people. However, in ancient times, this practice was riddled with misconceptions due to a lack of knowledge. People were mostly led by intuition, spirituality, and guesswork. One interesting hypothesis of the inner working of the human body was humourism. Mostly believed by the ancient Greeks, this idea posits that the body consists of 4 basic fluids (blood, phlegm, yellow- and black bile) that need to be kept in balance for good health. A lack or excess of any of these fluids was often given as a reason for mood swings or illness. Gruesomely (easy to say in hindsight of course), this theory was put to practice with techniques like bleeding which often did more harm than good. Around the 17th century, these theories began falling out of favour. The rise of the scientific method and proper instrumentation led to new discoveries such as germ theory and modern physiology. Since then, our understanding of the human body and advanced medicine has only improved and has augmented our quality of life significantly.",B,y,ae="While our predecessors can be excused for their misbelief, I strongly feel that similar mistakes are being made in the quest to understand deep neural networks (aka interpretability). Let us zoom in on some (subjective) mistakes made throughout history in medicine and propose analogues within interpretability. Afterwards, an outline of a promising solution is given.",O,v,se="A strong focus on the surface, disregarding the internals.",F,w,le="The internals of the human body are confusing, without our current knowledge of organs and their function, it is easy to understand how the insides of beings were often disregarded in favour of more intuitive theories. The same holds for neural networks, it seems we do not understand how its internals work, except for the input and output layers. Consequently, a considerable amount of research focuses on this surface, such as adversarial examples which confuse current models by perturbing the input with (humanly) imperceptible noise. However, similar to our previous story, any experiments in this domain remain quite high-level and do not intrinsically provide any insight. Drawing conclusions from the surface of such a complex (and sometimes illogical) system will inevitably lead to false conclusions.",z,g,re="<p>The study of adversarial examples has been immensely useful in protecting models from malicious input in practice. However, one must admit our lack of understanding towards their origin. Famously, adversarial defence mechanisms can be easily obviated by using slightly different techniques.</p>",G,b,he="Inadequate rigour and validation.",E,x,ue="When reading further about humourism, I was astounded as to why no one actually properly tested this hypothesis. While there is probably lots more to this that I don’t know about, the simple fact that “it seems reasonable” and provided a believable explanation was enough to justify its prevalence. In fact, the same often happens in modern academia, where results are often not verified, even when reproduction is not necessarily difficult (such as the superconductivity of LK-99). This is even the case within machine learning, where exact code can be shared and executed to validate claims. Yet, I’ve found myself using the “yeap, that looks about right” metric quite a lot when looking at most graphs and numbers in papers.",K,C,de="Absence of quantitative and causal experimentation.",Q,k,ce="Beyond the justification for negligence of rigour within science (ancient and modern), the root cause of false theories is probably a lack of tooling. The ancient Greeks didn’t have a microscope so how could they ever predict that microbes were the primary cause of illness? Furthermore, the scientific virtues, to guide their experiments, were not as developed back then. Within machine learning, we have full control and inspection capabilities of the full digital environment. There are no limitations other than our intelligence. Therefore, even though the field of machine learning is young, there is no excuse for sloppy science.",U,_,me="Still, a large majority of the field of interpretability is qualitative. A prominent example is heatmaps, which aim to depict which area of an image a model looks at most. The idea is that we, as humans, can then evaluate if the model is “doing what we want”. My main objections to this approach are: “What would this heatmap even look like” and more importantly: “What knowledge would we gain given a perfect heatmap”. At its core, a heatmap is simply a proxy for interpretability. The statement “if the model only looks at the cat, it must understand that it is a cat and therefore predict that” is a logical fallacy. The model may well fully highlight the cat, but if the fur of the cat is a bit too monkey-like, it may predict wrong, and we have no way of noticing this.",D,T,pe="<p>The motivations of most papers in this domain refer to the faulty horse detector, that heatmaps helped detect. However, this was also apparent from simpler factors such as the models increased confidence in detecting horses. Let me provide context; there was a model trained on a dataset in which almost all images of horses, exclusively, had a date on the bottom (an artefact from the camera presumably). By looking at the heatmaps, researchers found out the model was simply looking at the existence of the date to classify something as a horse.</p>",N,q,fe="<p>Heatmaps are not the only offender in this area, many highly acclaimed papers (which I won’t explicitly name) have the same issue.

Should we look at the composition of limbs, cells or even atoms to understand its function? Medicine has the advantage that most biological systems are surprisingly modular. Organs seem to be neatly separated by membranes and even within organs, there is lots of structure. For instance, lungs are conceptually just a tree structure that guides air towards small alveoli. This naturally defines a conceptual space for understanding the function of items.",R,P,we="Within machine learning, it seems more difficult to find such a granularity. Conceptually, we design neural networks layer by layer but these layers do not seem very interpretable. Some high-level approaches attempt to project the neuron activations (the data of each layer) onto a 2D plane, this shows that the network slowly learns to separate the data into distinct groups given its class (the answer). Comparably to previous approaches, this doesn’t reveal the exact working of the networks.",V,j,ge="Another approach is to dive deeper: onto the neuron level. The large body of research in this domain tells a semi-optimistic story. Some neurons are highly interpretable, activating on concrete concepts such as cars or dogs. However, beyond these cherry-picked few, there are many “poly-semantic” neurons which activate on completely unrelated stuff such as leaves and dice. Further, there are also some noise neurons which do not follow any coherent structure. In a sense this is logical, neurons need not represent human concepts. However, this renders the interpretability quite difficult.",X,L,be="Solution",Z,S,xe="Even though this explanation portrays the field of interpretability in a bad light, there is reason for hope. Given the current flaws, there is a strong trend towards a new form of interpretability: mechanistic interpretability. This field aims to “reverse engineer” a network, decomposing it into parts. This decomposition may be unfathomably complex, but it will provide a way to causally reason about models. It is achieved through a collection of low-level methods that are able to comprehensively describe certain parts of the model (which I plan to write another blog about later).",ee,W,Ce="Causally reasoning about the internals of any system is an exceedingly useful tool. For example, in biology, we can reason that removing an appendix has almost no causal effect on the proper functioning of the body (apparently this is not fully true, but whatever). These organs, which lost their function throughout evolution are called vestigial organs. It is not unexpected that neural networks may also have these vestigial subsections or neurons that once served a purpose during training but have been mostly replaced. If this proportion is significant, they could be removed to speed up the model. Beyond this, if we can causally reason about knowledge within a model, we could perform a slight update to update the model’s beliefs. Instead of attempting to rid training data of the model of racism or another unwanted human by-products, we can identify these sections and lobotomise (remove) them. Further, through causal reasoning, we can learn from models through the extraction of useful information in a chess AI for example. Lastly, we can use causal reasoning to identify failure cases within networks, which is immensely useful in highly sensitive industries for example.",te,A,ke="To reach real interpretability, we require more than simply the toolbox of mechanistic interpretability. I argue that there are two additional vital components in this endeavour: interactive dissemination and standardised databases. The first aims to increase the standard to which interpretability techniques are held. Interactive visualisations, for example, should allow users to browse through the presented claims on a specific model. Specifically, this avoids the shoddy scientific practice of cherry-picking. The second aims to propose a certain platform for common knowledge much like was done to uncover the human genome. If done right, this will leave room for the creative, scientific process but provide a sort of atlas of interpretability across several models.",ie,M,_e="In conclusion, there is a lot to learn from our journey through the understanding of the human body.
