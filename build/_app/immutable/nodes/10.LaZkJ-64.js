I consider this the main reason for my fascination with science, it is easy to delve into a certain topic as far as possible, down to the axioms or fundamental laws governing the universe.

There is an irresistible appeal to the visual nature of this field. While it’s bugs can be notoriously hard to track down, there is an inexplainable rush that comes from seeing all the maths and code come together into a beautiful virtual world. Furthermore, when studying this subject on my own in high school, I found tutorials really easy to follow, <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Base_code" rel="nofollow">especially this one on Vulcan</a>. I contribute this to the fact that the field is relatively easy to structure into (problem -&gt; algorithms). This results in, for example within Vulcan, that several algorithms or strategies are represented as an enum. Consequently, changing these values within the code is really trivial and its up- and downsides are usually quite clear.',u,x,nt="In contrast, the first time I looked at your typical neural networks introduction, I was very confused, almost all beginner tutorials were very high level and didn’t explain any intricacies with the choices being made. However, at this stage, I thought to myself that I probably didn’t have the correct resources or that I was missing some background, therefore I more or less ignored this until my first neural networks course at university. Here, the same high-level explanation was given, without significant attention to the why. Like many other initiates to the field, my biggest gripe where the seemingly arbitrary choices. These questions boiled down to: how the <em>bleep</em> did anyone come up with this? Or more importantly, why does any of this even work in the slightest?

All neurons that receive some kind or sensory signal are the input layer, all neurons directly connected to this are the first layer and so on. This approach however, has some flaws, primarily the brain isn’t a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which means there will be “back-edges” when performing this structuring. Within neural networks, these are simply removed because they are annoying to backpropagate through.</li> <li>Given this layerification of the brain, we can simply use an amount of layers equivalent to the diameter of the graph we wish to simulate (starting from the input). This guarantees that our network will be able to represent the full forward computation of the graph (e.g. the brain).</li> <li>The reason for this “overcomputation”, is that its simply very efficient to implement these dense neural layers in hardware through matrix multiplication.

Underestimating the complexity of a problem leads to a weak model that isn’t able to “understand” the data, called underfitting.

On the other hand, when using too many layers, the phenomenon of overfitting (memorizing all data samples) becomes prevalent.',Se,$,xt="When naively experimenting with neural networks, it seems difficult to avoid these regimes. I remember a time that I found it difficult to reach over 99.5% accuracy on MNIST, all my networks were peaking around the low 99% while you often hear that 99.8% is quite easy. A common response to this is that you simply need to pay close attention to the train/validation accuracies and try all kinds of setups empirically, which often seemed like a dumb response to me. How then did researchers come up with these exotic architectures such as ResNet, Inception, DenseNet and so forth, it must be more than sheer luck.",Ee,R,bt="All of this seems like a big deal when first starting in the field, but it actually really isn’t.

However, actually fully understanding the complexity of the situation requires quite a bit of effort and doesn’t lead to a satisfying response.",Ue,F,_t='For example, you may know dropout; this deactivates neurons randomly with the intention of forcing the network to be more robust to perturbances and therefore rely less on random patterns. There is also weight decay, which forces weights to generally be smaller and therefore avoid over-reliance on specific features which may not generally hold. These techniques under the umbrella of regularizers. However,  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530" rel="nofollow">an underappreciated paper</a> disproves this. They shuffle the labels of the whole training set, meaning all image-label pairs are deterministic but simply form a random pattern. Therefore, to achieve high accuracy, the network has no other choice than to overfit. However, the authors observe that most models can achieve near-perfect accuracy on training but even worse, that strongly regularized models can do so too. Now, the astute reader may make the observation that, even though there is some regularization, the model has no other choice but that within a normal regime the network will simply work better.

Concretely, working backwards, the last hidden layer should be linearly separable for good classification.
